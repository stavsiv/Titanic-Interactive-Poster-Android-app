    In 1912, the Titanic, the largest and most luxurious ship of its time,
    sets sail on its maiden voyage from England to America. Onboard, Jack Dawson,
    a free-spirited artist, meets Rose DeWitt Bukater, a young woman from a wealthy
    family who feels trapped by society\'s expectations.

    Despite coming from different worlds, they fall deeply in love. But their love story
    takes a tragic turn when the Titanic strikes an iceberg in the middle of the Atlantic.

    As the ship begins to sink, chaos erupts, and Jack and Rose must fight for survival.
    With time running out, their love is put to the ultimate test in a heart-wrenching
    struggle against fate.</string>
